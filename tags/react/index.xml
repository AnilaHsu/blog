      <description>What is Redux? Redux has several important concepts: store, action, and reducer.
Redux is used to manage the state of JavaScript apps. It is used to manage the state uniformly, containing the &amp;ldquo;global&amp;rdquo; state in a single store, and the state of the entire application will be stored in the store in the form of an object tree.
This state is read-only, through pure reducer functions look at those actions and return an immutably updated state, the only way to change the state is to change the state in the store through dispatch actions.</description>
