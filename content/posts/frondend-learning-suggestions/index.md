Recently, some friends have asked me for advice about transitioning into a career in frontend development. So, based on my personal experience, I have organized these questions and answers to share with those interested or preparing to change careers, hope the article can be helpful to you.

## Self-learning Phase

**What are the main learning resources you have used?**

For those just starting self-learning, I recommend gaining a basic understanding of the three main frontend languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. You can find easy-to-understand documents online. My main resources were primarily from MDN and online articles. You can also take advantage of various online resources, including free coding tutorial websites like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), or paid online learning platforms like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), as well as comprehensive tutorial resources provided by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

**How to build your skill tree?** 

The typical frontend development skill tree includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS, frontend frameworks like React or Vue, and a knowledge of how the internet works. In addition to frontend specializations, it's also very important to have the ability to collaborate with others, so learning to use and operate Git is also crucial. I suggest referring to the [Frontend Beginner Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner) and the [Frontend Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). You can also regularly read front-end related articles on Medium.

**How do you organize a full day of learning?** 

You can allocate time each day for theoretical learning, real-world practice, and review. Theoretical learning involves learning new concepts and principles; real-world practice involves casting the knowledge gained from theoretical learning into actual projects; and review involves considering the effectiveness and progress of what you've learned.

**What methods did you adopt for practice?**

You can initially refer to other people's works, or choose topics that interests you and start practicing with simple projects, then work your way up to more complex projects. If you're out of ideas, I would recommend referring to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), which has different difficulty levels and types of challenges. Once you have accumulated a certain amount of experience, you can try to practice collaborative development using GitHub. If you want to try something more challenging, you can try participating in open-source projects, or take on coding challenges on websites like LeetCode and Codewars.

## Job Hunting Phase

**At what point of self-learning should one start job hunting?**

To begin with, have the capability to independently complete a small frontend project, such as a website, a Todo list app, or a small app made with React / Vue. Next, amass a portfolio and related knowledge about frontend development, followed by proficiency in algorithms, as well as practice for behavioral and technical interviews. Once you have a certain level of command over these aspects, you can begin exploring job opportunities.

**How to find job opportunities in Japan?**

You can find overseas job opportunities through job hunting sites like [JapanDev](https://japan-dev.com/), [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) or popular platforms like Linkedin.

**How are Japanese interview processes different from other countries?**

Language is naturally a significant difference. In Japan, if you are interviewing with a Japanese company, there probably will be a part of the interview conducted in Japanese. whereas foreign companies might primarily in English. Besides, Japanese companies usually place a great emphasis on the applicant's seriousness. They may also ask questions to understand and test the applicant's knowledge about the company, motivation, and future goals. This might differ from the usual technical interview-focused style of most technology companies.

## After Successful Career Change

**What is generally valued in the Japanese working environment?** 

Generally, Japan values teamwork, professionalism, and a principled approach. Respect for work ethics and loyalty to the job are also highly valued in Japan's working environment. Capability is important, but attitude is often seen as more significant.

**What difficulties have you encountered in remote work?**

In my case, the company already had a flexible remote work policy that mainly operates on a responsibility basis, so as long as I take an hour off after working eight hours, it's all good. The difficulties might involve scenarios where immediate communication with colleagues isn't possible or the tendency to overwork due to extended periods of remote work. On the other hand, remote work allows for better management of personal time at times.

**How long did it take from self-learning to successfully transitioning into a new job?**

I had some front-end development experience before my previous job, so it roughly took me about six months. The time frame varies for each individual.

**What's your advice for those self-studying, transitioning careers, and targeting to work in Japan?**

It's crucial to be mentally prepared as the process might be filled with setbacks. You might encounter many challenges during the self-learning process or the interview process, but what we can do is to prepare ourselves as best as we can.

- **Language Preparation:** Whether the company's primary language is English or Japanese, accumulate foreign language ability as much as possible. Improving language skills not only enhances competitiveness but also gives you an advantage in the workplace, aids in understanding the working environment, contributes significantly to technical learning, enables better performance, allows for seizing better opportunities, and even strengthens relationships with colleagues.

- **Understanding Culture:** Each country's work culture has its unique aspects. Understanding the company culture in Japan and even the work style will help in adapting to the new environment.

- **Applying for Suitable Positions:** It's recommended to always seek job opportunities that align with your skills. Understand your advantages and look for matching open positions.

- **Practice Technical Interviews:** Regular practice and mastering interview techniques will be very beneficial before interviews. You can also seek mock interview opportunities to get accustomed to the interview process and atmosphere.

- **Continue Learning and Improving Skills:** Maintaining a mindset of continuous learning is very important. Learning new programming languages, frameworks, or even new soft skills can enhance your competitiveness.
