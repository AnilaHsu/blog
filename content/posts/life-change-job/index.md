### Preface.
I would like to thank my friends around me for meeting each other through different interactions, and thanks for taking care of my friends who care about me because your company has brought me warmth and happiness.

Thank you my friends in Seattle, USA, and the love of our Heavenly Father for accompanying me on this very long and difficult journey from the past to the present. Knowing those friends and The Christian Faith has been the most precious gift in my life.

### The little dream I had.

When I was young, my dream was to become a capable and influential girl, hoping to bring my family a happy life without worrying about finances; perhaps I can also help more people, and then enrich my experience by living abroad. Studying and working part-time is a daily routine, in order to apply for scholarships, pay for tuition and living expenses, and contribute to the family's expenses while giving myself more able to make more choices.

### My life's turning point.

It wasn't until I met great, thoughtful, and precious friends that I was inspired to explore more and try more to have the courage and confined face setbacks and to find the goal I really wanted to achieve based on my dreams.
therefore, I started to study programming, frontend, data, AI and other information technologies. After graduating, I chose to work directly in the financial industry in a data analysis and engineering role for a company undergoing a digital transformation. After joining the company, I worked hard with the office team to bring data thinking to the whole company, creating several data projects for the company from scratch, and gradually changing a traditional financial system company that was undergoing digital transformation.

### When I worked as a Data Engineer.

I can only say that this job has been an amazing experience and I have enjoyed my duties in this job. At first, I started from clean up the database, and also used Python, Oracle, and some analysis tools to handle and the analysis of the data from internal and external data! In addition to cleaning up the original data and visually analyzing the huge customer data, I have connected to the public APIs to convert the analyzed and processed information into valuable services through automatic storage in the DB; and I have created automated applets to reduce a large amount of manual data processing and also used GTM to perform online user analysis for the company's marketing and e-commerce departments, etc. But more than I have gained is being a Python instructor, leading the office team to learn programming concepts and techniques, and enjoying the technical exchange with each other.

### I left my last job and changed job.

Now, I left this job while continuing my self-learn, and started my next career as a software engineer-frontend Developer going to work in Tokyo, Japan.
Some of my friends may wonder why? not because I don't like to do data anymore. In the era of the AI boom, many people may think that data and AI are the modern mainstream, and I deeply feel the incredible value of this industry and the different contributions of different fields of technology.
However, for me, rather than working with and analyzing a lot of data in order to provide more accurate and valuable information to company. I enjoy learning new technologies more while focusing on developing and designing products, creating more services that can be used by users through technology, and integrating them into our daily lives, which is probably more fulfilling and exciting thing.


At the same time, in order to achieve a longer-term goal, I would like to bring my enthusiasm and courage to step out of my comfort zone life, to continue to learn and grow while working happily, to continue to accumulate technical strength and experience, and then to further challenge myself to enjoy life and enrich my life experience.

### Conclusion

I am very happy to share with you that I am fortunate to have the opportunity and ability to choose my favorite career in different paths, and to be able to have a life with more challenges unknown and full of excitement and anticipation in my favorite country.
For the sake of my family, I have been pursuing a more mature and capable version of myself, and perhaps it is time to pursue more of my life's meaning, career, and values. Go for it~~!
