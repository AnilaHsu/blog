The two-week study tour and I have been looking forward to it for two years！
<!--more-->

I am very lucky to apply for this biennial study tour program, although I missed the opportunity to travel with my twin sister because of the university entrance examination, I am still very very excited to come to Seattle and meet friends whom I haven’t seen for a long time.

Unlike the hot Taiwanese summer, Seattle’s summer climate is cool and comfortable, but the temperature difference between morning and evening is large, so you need to bring a jacket to go out often.

Two weeks in Seattle, I live with the host family. I lived in Aunt Rolan’s house and Aunt Sue’s house each for a week. I was taken care of like their kids, very warm and happy. It is a very unforgettable memory for me who lived independently since childhood.

These friends and host families are family members from the Seattle church. Every summer vacation, these Seattle church families will go to our junior high school alma mater for English learning camps. With this fate, I am very fortunate to know these friends and the Christian faith.

Probably one of the most memorable in America is the celebration party, the party culture I experienced for the first time is this welcome party. As the welcome party progresses, it also opens the prelude to this study tour.

In addition to course learning, we also visited many places and participated in local events, and served as a Washington student for one day.

Summer is the season for blueberries. One of the best recreations in Seattle this season is to pick fruit from the farm. We came to Bow Hill Blueberries on August 5th, the third day of studying abroad to pick blueberries, just buy a five US dollar Pass, and you can pick and eat at the blueberry garden, because it was close to the end of the blueberry season, although there were not many full fruits left, we still had a great time picking.

But when we are exposed to the sun, we are about to have heat stroke. Next time we go to pick fruits, remember to bring more water and apply sunscreen.

On the fourth day of the study tour, we came to downtown Seattle, in addition to visiting the famous Space Needle, we also went to Gas Works Park to watch the sunset. This is probably the most beautiful park I have ever seen! Very suitable for picnics.

Microsoft is one of the technology companies that came to Seattle for a visit. Special thanks to Uncle Fan for taking us to his company to open up our vision for technological development.

After visiting Microsoft in the afternoon, we went to Aunt Su’s house for a barbecue party for dinner and then participated in the local outdoor cinema experience in the evening.

In this very vast United States, as long as you are over sixteen, you can learn to drive and test your driver’s license. Most students drive to school by themselves, and some take the bus to school, but usually, they also need family members to pick them up and drop them off at the bus stop.

It is the oldest university on the west coast of the United States and the largest university in the Northwest of the United States. It has 16 colleges, including the School of Medicine, the School of Social Work, and the School of Information at the top.

This is a pier with a history of hundreds of years in downtown Seattle. The seabirds on the pier are very relatives. In addition to watching the pier, watching the seabirds stand in line is very interesting!

I’m busy feeling the present during the journey and mark this journey with the beautiful night view, in a blink of an eye, one week is over, there is only one week left for the study tour, I can’t help feeling for separation Sad, with the company and care of these friends, my heart is full of warmth and gratitude. Every experience is the first time, which is novel and exciting.

Especially want to thank Aunt Rolan for one week to take care of me, because he All of his children moved out of the house and only she lived alone, so she was really happy to be with him for a week, also very happy to be able to go to Aunt Rolan’s mother’s house to accompany grandma for dinner, get along with grandma My time is like being with my grandmother. It’s especially heartwarming. The home-cooked dishes cooked by my grandmother are also very human kindness.
