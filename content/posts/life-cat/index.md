### I adopted Mimi from Changhua!

  <!--more-->

#### The story of my encounter with mimi:

The first time I saw mimi was when I posted a post on the tea shop website. The sister of an intern colleague was looking for a new owner for mimi. I always wanted to adopt a pet. I was very excited. After a few days of hesitation, I decided to ask my colleagues about the adoption status, but there was no result. Thinking that such a cute cat has not been adopted yet, I made up my mind to adopt mimi.

I brought mimi back from Changhua to my current rental home just before New Year's Eve. Because I didn't prepare well, I bought Mimi's cat litter, cat litter house, cans, and bowls that day. Mimi was really busy on the first day of her arrival. I didn't know how to comfort her. I did a lot of homework and checked a lot of information. , After reading many netizens’ sharing and asking some friends who have experience in raising cats, I sorted out the following experiences to share with you.

### Meow Meow Precautions

#### Note 1:
Cats are usually not used to the new environment. You can prepare a quieter and more comfortable space for the cat. You can also give the cat familiar items to make it feel at ease ex. You can give the cat the food that it will eat before and use it before. Cat litter, as well as the cat's previous toys, etc.

#### Note 2:
The cat may go to a new environment and may hide in the corners of the house or high above. You don’t need to pay too much attention to the cat, just let the cat get familiar with the new environment slowly (one week to one month after the cat is older). Before bringing the cat back, try to remove it Clean up the house so that the cat can feel comfortable and keep the cat clean.

#### Note 3:
It is necessary to confirm whether the cat is ligated, vaccinated, and microchipped. If you want to take the cat out, it is recommended that it is safer to vaccinate the cat. If the cat wants to be a house cat, it is not necessary to have the microchipped. The purpose of the microchipped is to help the cat get lost. Assist owners in finding lost pets.

#### Note 4:
Before the cat goes home, prepare the things the cat needs, mainly the cat's toilet-cat litter and litter box, cat food-canned food/feed. You can also prepare cat scratching boards to prevent cats from scratching randomly, and cat toys can also prevent cats from biting things at home, and having toys can also help consume cats’ energy.

#### Note 5:
Most cats don’t like to drink water. You can put water in many places in the house. When the cat passes by, the water may drink. You can also give the cat more canned food, because canned food is rich in water. Compared with dry feed, it is rich in Canned food with water content is healthier for cats.

#### Note 6:
Feed for cats is divided into staple food cans and non-staple food cans. The staple food cans are more balanced and sufficient for cats. The non-staple food cans are more delicious than the teachings. The staple food cans are usually more expensive than the non-staple food cans. When canning, you can pay attention to whether it is a staple food or a non-staple food can.

#### Note 7:
Remember to buy flea medicine for cats, once a month to help cats on the skin of the neck, to avoid too many fleas on cats, causing discomfort to cats, because cats are hotter than humans, fleas like it very much, and to avoid fleas at home The environment produces too much flea poop, and it's even more important to avoid fleas lurking around the home ready to target your cat.

You can prepare high jump platforms or give cats a space to jump. In addition, cat teasers, strings , Tumbler dolls, most cats also like it, you can prepare them for cats.

### Meow Meow Daily Essentials

#### Point 1 - About cat litter:

  Cat litter can be divided into bean curd sand, mineral sand, sawdust sand, etc. Cat litter is usually changed once a week. We use tofu sand because tofu sand is more environmentally friendly and can be flushed directly into the toilet. It is close to the cat's instinct to find the toilet, but it can't flush the toilet and can only throw garbage, and the sawdust litter can be used in single-layer and double-layer cat litter boxes, and there are also types that can flush the toilet and those that are not thick enough to flush the toilet. Remember that the cat litter box should not be placed near food and water, because cats don't like food or water next to the toilet.

#### POINT 2 - ABOUT TOYS:

Most cats are very interested in things that move quickly, such as feathers and lines. Therefore, there are many cat teasers made of similar materials on the market. The cat teaser is not only a source of energy consumption for cats, but also one of the joys of life for cats. , For cats, they never tire of playing. In addition, most cats are also fascinated by the sound of rubbing plastic bags, so some pet shops will sell dolls with plastic rubbing sounds. For example, our cats often hold dolls and learn how to kick rabbits. They are so cute!

#### POINT 3 - ABOUT DIET:

Cats are carnivorous, and the source of nutrition they need is animal protein. Because cats have less amylase in their bodies, they are not suitable for eating foods that contain a lot of grains (carbohydrates) or plant ingredients. For cats, canned food is better than dry food. Also healthy and nutritious.

The biggest advantage of dry feed is that it can be stored at room temperature and stored for a long time. However, dry feed usually has high carbohydrate content and relatively high calories. In addition, dry feed lacks water. For cats who do not like to drink water, long-term consumption is prone to Obesity, diabetes, overweight and even kidney disease, so I mainly feed our cats canned food.

The main point of choosing canned food is to check the ingredient label of the canned food and avoid choosing excessive and unnecessary ingredients, such as: corn, soybeans, potatoes that are easy to cause cat allergies, or BHT, BHA, BPA (bisphenols) that are suspected of causing cancer. A) etc.
Canned food is divided into two types: staple food cans and non-staple food cans. If the canned food packaging is marked with AAFCO (American Feed Control Association) or NRC certification, it is basically a staple food can.

The staple food cans are more suitable as the main meal for cats. The staple food cans can be selected without unnecessary additives such as controversial gums, fruits and vegetables, grains, and traditional Chinese medicines. In addition to the high meat content, the staple food cans also have a water content of at least 70%, while the non-staple food cans pay less attention to nutrients and taste salty. For cats who do not eat wet food and only eat dry food, non-staple food cans can Foods used to trick cats into drinking more water, but if cats are willing to eat light taste and drink water, they should avoid giving cans of non-staple food and snacks with strong taste and salty taste.

### Conclusion
I am not a professional cat beater or a senior cat slave, but I want to be a competent cat mother, and I hope to share more about my daily life with cats in the future!
